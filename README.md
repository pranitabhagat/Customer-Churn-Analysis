# Customer-Churn-Analysis

This project involves helping a RBC Bank better understand its customer churns.
It is advantageous for banks to know what leads a client towards the decision to leave the company.
Churn prevention allows companies to develop loyalty programs and retention campaigns to keep as many customers as possible.

The goal is to analyse the data and bring out few insights on the customer Churn.
