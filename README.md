# Customer Churn Analysis Project

Welcome to the Customer Churn Analysis project! This project focuses on understanding the factors that contribute to customer churn in the banking industry. In this readme file, you will find an overview of the project, the data dictionary describing the dataset used, and the objectives of our analysis.

## About the Project

The primary goal of this project is to analyze customer churn in the banking industry and identify insights that can help prevent customer attrition. By understanding the factors that lead customers to leave the bank, we can develop loyalty programs and retention campaigns to retain as many customers as possible.

## Data Dictionary

To conduct our analysis, we will be using a dataset containing the following attributes:

- **RowNumber**: Corresponds to the record (row) number and has no effect on the output.
- **CustomerId**: Contains random values and has no effect on customer churn.
- **Surname**: The surname of a customer has no impact on their decision to leave the bank.
- **CreditScore**: Represents a customer's credit score, which can influence their likelihood of churn.
  - Excellent: 800-850
  - Very Good: 740-799
  - Good: 670-739
  - Fair: 580-669
  - Poor: 300-579
- **Geography**: Indicates the customer's location, which can affect their decision to leave the bank.
- **Gender**: Represents the customer's gender, which can be explored to understand its role in churn.
- **Age**: The age of the customer, which is relevant since older customers are less likely to churn.
- **Tenure**: Refers to the number of years that the customer has been a client of the bank. Older clients are typically more loyal and less likely to churn.
- **Balance**: The customer's account balance, which is a good indicator of churn as higher balances are associated with lower churn rates.
- **NumOfProducts**: The number of products that a customer has purchased through the bank.
- **HasCrCard**: Denotes whether or not a customer has a credit card. Customers with a credit card are less likely to churn.
- **IsActiveMember**: Indicates whether a customer is an active member, as active customers are less likely to churn.
- **EstimatedSalary**: Similar to account balance, customers with higher salaries are less likely to churn.
- **Exited**: Whether or not the customer left the bank.
  - 0 represents "Retain"
  - 1 represents "Exit"
- **Bank DOJ**: Date when the customer associated/joined the bank.
